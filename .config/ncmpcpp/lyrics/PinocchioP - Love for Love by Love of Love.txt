Rotting a heart, they're eating alive
The lily will struggle and try not to die
Seeing you smile and hearing you speak
Feeling a pulse again, now it could beat
Walking together, you're taking me home
Ice cream enjoying, I wasn't alone
Hiding the feelings, a secret to keep
Hiding it terribly

I stumbled and fell into a love
I stumbled and fell into a love
Sparking and scattered from me
Dancing upon the thinning ice ever melting
I stumbled and fell into a love
I stumbled and fell into a love
The very same
Feeling I always would shame
It was a love in me

Fleeting and oh so green
Mistakes and everything

Falling in love with love on that day
Falling in love with love on that day
Later then turning and killing the flame
Killing the flame, killing the flame
Too many memories staining it red
Dripping in blood, a sun that'll set
Shut in my room, alone I would stand
Trying to end it but I can't
Falling in love with love on that day
What is the face a person should make?
Driving insane
Love for love
And by the love
And in the name of love
That love...was selfish and just loved love

Doubting the manual only to find
They didn't plan for a future outside
Only believing in what was a dream
Happy and beautiful, waiting for me
What they believed in, it all was a lie
Even their values were different alike
Laughing together, the sound that we made
Drifted away

So it was a young and dumb love
So it was a young and dumb love
Like a moth to a flame
Dancing along every street lamp until day
So it was a young and dumb love
So it was a young and dumb love
"It really hurt you, huh?"

Falling in love with love, on that day
Falling in love with love, on that day
Later then seeing it passing away
Passing away, Passing away
Too many memories tied to the moon
All of it hurting me, all of the wounds
Thinking of all of the wonderful times
It's hard to leave it all behind
Falling in love with love on that day
Telling a lie I'll never escape
Filling with hate
Love for love
And by the love
And in the name of love…
That love...was rotten but it was love

Fleeting and a green glass love

Falling in love with love on that day
Falling in love with love on that day
Later then turning and killing the flame
Killing the flame, Killing the flame
Killing the flame, Killing the flame
Killing the flame, Killing the flame
Killing the flame...
Killing it but still won't go away

Falling in love with love on that day
Falling in love with love on that day
Later then turning and killing the flame
Killing the flame, Killing the flame
Too many memories staining it red
Dripping in blood, a sun that'll set
Shut in my room, alone I would stand
Trying to end it, but I can't
Falling in love with love, on that day
What is the face, a person should make?
Driving insane
Love for love
And by the love
And in the name of love…
That love…
That love...
Was a mistake that is made by everyone

But I felt it
And I know that it was love
Even now I know it's love
