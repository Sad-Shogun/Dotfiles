I made a promise I swore I'd keep
All that I wanted was to find
Something to live for, something to stand for
And if I die for what I believe
Then this was worth it, and all the hurting
Is only memory

I'm up against the edge but I won't run away
The sky is turning red but I still got my faith
I feel it in my bones
Yeah, I think I've always known
It would end like this

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this

I won't say I'm sorry, you made your choice
We're not so different, are we?
I hear your voice inside me, yeah, you remind me
To keep on fighting with all my heart
Just like you told me, nothing can stop me
From getting what I want

I'm up against the edge but I won't run away
The sky is turning red but I still got my faith
I feel it in my bones
Yeah, I think I've always known
It would end like this

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It would end like this

In my heart I knew it, we'd end up here
Walking through the ruins, but there's no
Tears on my face, I know it's too late
To try and tempt fate, as if I could
I'll never hold back, I know you know that
You always understood
